Face.exe is a face detection and face recognition web application.

***Note:*** 

>  - *It is hosted on free hosting service so it might be little slow    sometimes, PLEASE always use Google chrome for the best 			  results
> and less wait*
>    
>  - *Currently the Image upload and train model functionality is not working, although you can successfully upload the images using upload
> functionality but it won't update that in database, currently I have
> stored it locally in an array insted of database. In order to test the
> Select image button functionality just select the sample images given
> in image folder. or use the photos of following actors from the
> internet.  list: ['leonardo de caprio', 'robert pattinson', 'chris
> evans', 'tom cruse', 'robert downey', 'johnny depp', 'will smith']*
>  - *Because of time and money constrains this functionality was not completed but it is very easy to do and can be easly done by switching
> to the premium firebase plan.*
